📊 Netflix Watch History BI Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Netflix watch-history data to uncover user engagement patterns and support data-driven business decisions.

The analysis is developed in Python and deployed as an interactive Streamlit BI dashboard.

The dashboard focuses on engagement, viewing behavior, and subscription performance, similar to real-world analytics use cases at streaming platforms.

🎯 Objectives

-> Identify key engagement metrics Netflix should track

-> Analyze watch behavior across subscription types and devices

-> Understand user viewing frequency and content interaction

-> Build an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.10

Pandas – data manipulation and aggregation

Matplotlib – analytical visualizations

Streamlit – interactive BI dashboard

VS Code – local development

📈 Key Metrics & Visualizations

1️⃣ Total Watch Time by Subscription Type

Purpose:

Identifies which subscription tier drives the highest engagement.

Business Insight:

Higher watch time indicates higher customer lifetime value.

2️⃣ Average Watch Time by Device

Purpose:

Analyzes user behavior across devices such as Mobile, TV, 
Tablet, and Desktop.

Business Insight:

Helps prioritize UI/UX and streaming performance improvements by device.

3️⃣ Viewing Frequency per User

Purpose:

Measures how often users return to the platform.

Business Insight:

High-frequency users indicate strong retention; low-frequency users signal churn risk.
